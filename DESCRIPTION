Description: ReLTER provides access to DEIMS-SDR (https://deims.org/), and
    allows interaction with data and software implemented by eLTER
    Research Infrastructure (RI) thus improving data sharing among
    European LTER projects.  ReLTER uses the R language to access and
    interact with the DEIMS-SDR archive of information shared by the Long
    Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. This package grew within
    eLTER H2020 as a major project that will help advance the development
    of European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Infrastructures (eLTER RI -
    https://elter-ri.eu).  The ReLTER package functions in particular
    allow to: - retrieve the information about entities (e.g. sites,
    datasets, and activities) shared by DEIMS-SDR (see e.g. get_site_info
    function); - interact with the ODSEurope (maps.opendatascience.eu)
    starting with the dataset shared by DEIMS-SDR (https://deims.org/)
    (see e.g. the get_site_ODS() function); - use the eLTER site
    informations to download and crop geospatial data from other platforms
    (see e.g. get_site_ODS function()); - improve the quality of the
    dataset (see e.g. get_id_worms()).  Functions currently implemented
    are derived from discussions of the needs among the eLTER users
    community.  The ReLTER package will continue to follow the progress of
    eLTER-RI and evolve, adding new tools and improvements as required.
